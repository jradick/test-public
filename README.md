# test-public
Temporary repo for testing features of a Public repository with my account

## What this is

9 April 2023

This is a repository for me to use to test how things work on github.

I've used github for many years, but for my own repositories
I've only done trivial tasks with my own repositories.

Repositories requiring nontrivial administration have been controlled
by other people I work with so I only deal with making changes,
pull requests, reviews, etc.

So, this particular repository is a sandbox for me to play around with
to experiment with github features.

## Open Source

I've worked in the computer industry for several decades,
and I've used open source software for much of it,
but the code I have written has been for employers building
proprietary products not involving changes to open source code.

This and related repositories are my attempt at placing some work
that I do in my own time with my own resources into public view.

## Copyright and related matters

Unless otherwise specified, I retain copyright to all files in this repository.

I make no claims as to any of this material containing any original inventions,
unless otherwise indicated.  To the best of my knowledge, nothing here
uses any patent or copyright except where explicitly noted.

If others find that I have infringed on any copyright, patent, or trademark,
please let me know and if it is a legitimate claim I will gladly change
the contents, either to remove the infringing material, or to provide
suitable attribution.  Probably anything I'd have to pay for will be removed.

## Committing

It is my intention that the only contributions to this particular repository
(jradick/test-public) will be made by me, or by people authorized to do so
by me to assist me with my experimentation.
